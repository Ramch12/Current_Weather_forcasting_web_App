I have used to geocoder API of mapquest to convert the geographic location in lattitude in longitude.
I have used openweather API to get the current weather data.
I have also used the winston logger to logging the error in a log file.
TO get the current weather information enter the address,country and zipcode and send the request .After sending the request You will get the data of current weather of place which had been
ethered by you .
